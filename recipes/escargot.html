    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        It should surprise no one that escargot comes from France. Escargot is the French word for snails, so seeing that word on a menu does refer to the French preparation of snails, which is the one in this escargot recipe. However, snails are eaten in other parts of the world aside from France. It is not uncommon to find snails in other parts of Europe (such as Spain), Southeast Asia, and even in African countries. Interestingly, throughout most of history snails were considered a 'poor man's food' not to be served in fine dining. However, due to the growing popularity of French cooking as the 'mother cuisine,' chefs brought snails or escargot to the mainstream, even bringing them to now be considered a delicacy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small-med Shallot finely diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Parsley finely chopped into dust-like texture (¼ cup or more)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon White wine</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper or to taste</li>
        <li>24 Escargots (large) canned</li>
        <li>24 Escargot shells optional</li>
        <li>1 cup Salted butter softened to room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove butter from the fridge and allow it to soften to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Open the can of escargot and drain out the liquid.</li>
        <li>Allow the escargot to sit in the strainer for a few minutes to remove more liquid.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely mince about 10 cloves of garlic. When you think you've minced it enough, mince it even more. This should take a while.</li>
        <li>Finely dice/mince a small shallot as small as you can, but don't macerate the shallot.</li>
        <li>Remove parsley leaves from the stems. Pinch them into a tight stack and slice, then mince until parsley is in "flake" or "dust" texture.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add softened butter, garlic, shallot, parsley, white wine, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly mix butter together. An electric mixture could be used for this, but it is absolutely not necessary.</li>
        <li>Use a small spoon or a teaspoon measure to scoop out the base layer of butter.</li>
        <li>Whether using shells or an escargot plate, add one scoop to the vessel.</li>
        <li>Then, top with a drained escargot, then add another scoop on top. You may need to use your fingers to press it down, as the escargot should be covered in butter.</li>
        <li>If you are using just a baking dish and no shells or escargot dish, you'll want to use roughly 1 cup of garlic butter for 24 snails. (2 teaspoons times 24 = 1 cup).</li>
        <li>Bake in a 400º F oven for 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>The garlic should no longer be raw, and the edges of the butter should begin to brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and cool slightly, then enjoy!</li>
