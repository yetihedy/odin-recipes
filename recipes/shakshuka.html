    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>1 14 ounce canned diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 14 ounce can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and cook for about 10 minutes until the onions become soft and translucent. Stir in garlic and cook for an additional minute until the garlic becomes fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour the tomatoes and tomato sauce, and add cumin, paprika and coriander. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until the tomato sauce thickens like a stew, about 10-15 minutes.</li>   
        <li>Create 6 small nests in the tomato stew. Gently crack the eggs into the skillet over the tomatoes in the nests formed. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet, and cook until the egg whites have set, about 5-8 minutes, depending on your desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with crusty bread or pita.</li>
    </ol>
